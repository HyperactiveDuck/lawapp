# Working Prompts & Guidelines

## Mobile-First PWA Requirements

This needs to be a mobile first pwa. Everything should be designed with mobile views in mind and come to first.

This is a demo app hence aside from user accounts it is okay for every data to be harcdoded to the design.

Everything that the users see should be in turkish

## Design Philosophy for LawApp

- The application must be mobile-first and fully responsive, ensuring an excellent user experience on all devices.
- The visual style should be modern, clean, and professional, suitable for a legal services platform.
- Use a minimalist color palette with high contrast for readability and accessibility; avoid bright or playful colors.
- Typography should be clear, legible, and consistent throughout the app.
- All UI elements (buttons, forms, cards, etc.) should have a sleek, flat design with subtle shadows or borders for depth, but no excessive decoration.
- Avoid the use of emojis or informal icons; use only professional, simple icons where necessary.
- All user-facing text must be in Turkish.
- Prioritize usability and clarity in all layouts and interactions.
- All demo data (except user accounts) can be hardcoded for design purposes.

*This design philosophy must be followed for all current and future development work on this project.*
